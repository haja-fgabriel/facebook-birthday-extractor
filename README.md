# facebook-birthday-extractor
Realistic scraper that extracts your Facebook friends' birthdays in a calendar format.
Hopefully, it's going to work for a long time, until Facebook decides to do an UI change.

## Setup

1. Create a new venv with `python -m venv env`
2. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install the project as editable with `pip install -e .` (yes, with period)
4. `cd src/`
5. `scrapy crawl facebook`
6. Enjoy :)
